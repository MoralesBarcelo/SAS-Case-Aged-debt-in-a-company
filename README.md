# SAS-Case-Aged-debt-in-a-company

/******************************* Global Aged Debt Program***********************************************/

/* Objective: Show how SAS can help us to manipulate data to explain, for example, how the customers debt
is accumulated through the time.

Introduction: For almost any company the aged Debt is a mandatory process to follow because 
 not all the debt is easy to rescue. Time is relentless, and debt is not the exception.

For that reason we will use a few tables with different customers info to discover what is
the actual debt that the company must handle and what is their distribution in time*/
